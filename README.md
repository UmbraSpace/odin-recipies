This will be a website constructed from HTML consisting of links to a number of recipies from a main index page.

When I'm finished, I will have demonstrated some degree of skill in utilizing anchor, image, paragraph, heading,
and list tags. I'll need to properly organize the file structure of the website and link to the appropriate page
or asset in the attribute of each anchor and image tag.
